    <blockquote>
        “All men dream: but not equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds 
        wake up in the day to find it was vanity, but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, 
        for they may act their dreams with open eyes, to make it possible.”

        <h2>WHERE I AM FROM</h2>
        <p>Born in the vibrant city of Mumbai, India's City of Dreams, I was embraced by its dynamic spirit, 
            where ancient traditions blend with modern aspirations. Mumbai, with its iconic Gateway of India and the picturesque 
            Marine Drive, has always been a city that pulses with life and diversity.</p>
        <p>However, much of my life was spent in the historic city of Hyderabad, a place where heritage and modernity 
            coexist in harmony. Known for the majestic Charminar and the bustling HITEC City, Hyderabad is a city of contrasts, 
            blending rich history with a forward-looking vision. This city, with its unique blend of culture and technology, 
            has been a significant part of my journey, offering a second home filled with warmth and ambition.</p>
